This is the documentation of [this project](https://github.com/pe712/PSC). It is based on the [f1tenth project](https://f1tenth.org/learn.html). The purpose of this repository is to help installating f1tenth simulator on remote windows PC, running experiments on the racecar and running our source code. This documentation also focuses on some difficulties we encountered.

Note that we avoided writting code and documentation specific to our racecar configuration as much as possible. However, there is probably a lot of adaptation if you want to use this repository in a different lab.

You will find documentation about :
- installation (which is painful)
- bringup (how to use our source code)
- purepursuit algorithm (theory)
- rosbags (what are they, how to use them)
- main clases (documentation specific to our python scripts to help understand them)
